		<p class="sub bold"> The Three Basic Trigonometric Functions </p> <br />
		<p class="sub"> Trigonometry is the study of the angles in triangles. There are three basic <b>trigonometric functions</b>
						that relate the angles in right triangles to the length of their sides. </p>
		<br /> <br />
		
		<ul class="p-true">
			<li> <b>Sine</b> — 
				 <span> The sine of an angle, written as <code>sin(x)</code>, is equal to the length of the side of the right triangle
						<b>opposite</b> from it divided by the length of the <b>hypotenuse</b> of the triangle. </span> </li>
			<li> <b>Cosine</b> — 
				 <span> The cosine of an angle, written as <code>cos(x)</code>, is equal to the length of the side of the right triangle
						<b>adjacent</b> to it divided by the length of the <b>hypotenuse</b> of the triangle. </span> </li>
			<li> <b>Tangent</b> — 
				 <span> The tangent of an angle, written as <code>tan(x)</code>, is equal to the length of the side of the right triangle
						<b>opposite</b> from it divided by the length of the <b>adjacent</b> side. </span> </li>
		</ul>
		
		<br /> <br />
		
		<p class="sub"> Let's see an example. </p>
		<img src="../../images/right-triangle.png" alt="Image of Right Triangle" />
		<p class="sub"> We can figure out the measure of angle <i>a</i> using sine, cosine, or tangent.</p> <br />
		
		<ul class="p-true">
			<li> <b>Using sine:</b>
				 <span> Sine is the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse. The opposite side of angle <i>a</i> has a length of 3, and the
						hypotenuse has a length of 5, so we know <code>sin(a) = 3 / 5</code>.</li>
			<li> <b>Using cosine:</b>
				 <span> Cosine is the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse. The adjacent side of angle <i>a</i> has a length of 4, and the
						hypotenuse has a length of 5, so we know <code>sin(a) = 4 / 5</code>.</li>
			<li> <b>Using tangent:</b> 
				 <span> Tangent is the opposite side divided by the adjacent side. The opposite side of angle <i>a</i> has a length of 3, and the
						adjacent side has a length of 4, so we know <code>sin(a) = 5 / 4</code>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br /> <br />
		
		<p class="sub"> But how do we find out what angle <i>a</i>'s measure actually is? We use something called
						<b>inverse trigonometric functions</b>. Just like we can reverse multiplication with division, we can
						reverse trigonometric functions with inverse trigonometric functions.</p> <br />
		<p class="sub"> The inverse trigonometric functions are written as <code>sin<sup>-1</sup>(x)</code>, <code>cos<sup>-1</sup>(x)</code>, and <code>tan<sup>-1</sup>(x)</code>.
						</p> <br />
		<p class="sub"> Just as (given that x is an angle) <code>sin(x) = opposite / hypotenuse</code>, <code>sin<sup>-1</sup>(opposite / hypotenuse) = x</code>.
		
		<br /> <br />
		
		<p class="sub"> Therefore, using the sine example above, if <code>sin(a) = 3 / 5</code>, then <code>sin<sup>-1</sup>(3 / 5) = x</code>.
						We can use a calculator to find that <code>sin<sup>-1</sup>(3 / 5) = 36.89</code> degrees. </p>
